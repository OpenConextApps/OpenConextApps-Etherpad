EtherpadLite Gadget
==============================

The Etherpad Lite gadget uses the REST interface of the eplconext-application 
as it's backend. To transfer credentials, the gadget creates signed 
OAuth-requests for the eplconext-application, based on 3-legged OAuth.


* Canvas-view

In Gadget-home-view, the user can either select a pad, or add a new pad.
When a pad is selected, the pad is set into the 'padparam' UserPref, and
the view is changed into Canvas (large). This view initializes from
the 'padparam' UserPref, which means:
  1- Request a session for the pad, for the group and the user; this
       results in a one-time-token, that has the (signed) credentials
       attached to it
  2- Embed a stripped-view of the eplconext-application in an iframe;
       this view shows the pad title and the etherpad editor; the
       one-time-token is used to link this request to the previous request
       and let user credentials be resolved


* Gadget-mode

The gadget can act in different modes, differentiating between the way
how the groups of the gadget is resolved: 
  1- SURFconext mode, in which the group is read from the implicit
       'groupContext' UserPref
  2- OpenSocial mode, in which the group is set in an explicit UserPref
       that the user must select from the list of available groups of
       the gadget container
  3- OpenSocial/Remote Group Provider mode, in which the group is set
       in an explicit UserPref that the user must select from the list
       of available groups of a *remote* OpenSocial container
       (this would be SURFconext)
     Note: this mode is NOT yet supported by SURFconext


* Implementation and deployment notes

The different behaviour of the gadget in its two different modes are
realized in a server side script that renders the appropriate XML for
each different context. The script requires an argument in the query-
string to decide how to render itself. This should be resolved in
an URL-rewriting configuration. 
Using Apache as webservr, this must be defined like this:

  - in sites-available/etherpad.host.name.com:
  
    <Directory /var/www/etherpad.conext.surfnetlabs.nl/eplconext/gadget>
      ...
      RewriteEngine on
      RewriteBase /eplconext/gadget
      # Rewrite for gadget.xml requests
      RewriteRule ^(t-eplconext.*\.xml)$ gadget.xml.php?r=$1 [NC]
      ...
    </Directory>
    
  - or the Rewrite configuration can be done in a .htaccess file as
    well 
  
This configuration leads to the following allowed gadget.xml filenames:
  1- /eplconext/t-eplconext.xml : SURFconext native mode
  2- /eplconext/t-eplconext-os.xml : OpenSocial mode
  3- /eplconext/t-eplconext-os-conext.xml.xml : OpenSocial mode with remote
        container as group provider (does not work yet)
